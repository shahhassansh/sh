# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-spin fa-fw"></i> About me #

* I'm a Ph.D. student at [Center for Research in Computer Vision (CRCV)](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/) of University of Central Florida (UCF) under the supervision of [Prof. Chen Chen](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/chenchen/). Before joining UCF, I obtained my Master's degree in Department of Computer Science at University of Central Florida in 2020, advised by [Prof. Yan Solihin](https://sites.google.com/view/arpers). I received my Bachelor's Degree in Department of Computer Science at Lahore University of Management Sciences in 2014.
