# Performance Evaluation of Boosted 2-stream TCRNet

## Abstract
Target detection in infra-red imagery is a particularly challenging problem due to the presence of terrain clutter. The TCRNet-2
CNN architecture was introduced to combat this issue, and has been
shown to perform better than conventional networks such as faster RCNN
and YOLOv3 . In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the boosted
2-stream TCRNet in detail (including robustness to range variations,
performance under day and night conditions) and compare it with that
of YOLOv5. A MWIR data set released by DSIAC is used for training
and testing the network. We also propose the MWIR Target classifier
that recognizes the 10 classes in the NVESD Dataset and achieves an
accuracy of 65.72% which is state-of-the-art to date.
