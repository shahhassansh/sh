I successfully passed my Ph.D. Dissertation Defense at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) of the University of Washington (UW). 

The title of my dissertation is "Robust Video Object Tracking via Camera Self-Calibration". My supervisory committee includes [Prof. Jenq-Neng Hwang](https://people.ece.uw.edu/hwang/) (Chair), [Prof. Kenneth P. Bube](https://math.washington.edu/people/kenneth-p-bube) (GSR), [Prof. Linda G. Shapiro](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shapiro/), [Prof. Ming-Ting Sun](https://people.ece.uw.edu/sun/), and [Prof. Fa-Long Luo](https://ipl-uw.github.io/fa-long-luo.html). I appreciate all the support from my committee, colleagues, sponsors, family, friends, and my faith.
