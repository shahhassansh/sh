I like joining various hackathon challenges. In May 2019, my team participated in [Code for the Kingdom (C4TK) - Seattle 2019](https://codeforthekingdom.org/seattle-hackathon-2019.html) and won the People's Choice Award. 

Within 24 hours, we developed an app in Python with Tk GUI that randomly generates scripture art, i.e., images with Bible verse(s), for the user. To ensure that the color of the scripture text has high contrast against the background, we compute the mean color of the background, and find the complement color in the HSV color space for the text. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/blackmacy/Scripture_Art).
