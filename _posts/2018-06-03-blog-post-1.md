I was elected to be a [Session Elder](https://www.upc.org/connect/leadership/elders/) of the [University Presbyterian Church (UPC)](https://www.upc.org/). 

Elders are active members of the church who serve in government, leadership, and ministry. We are persons of faith, dedication, and good judgment, nominated and elected by the congregation. Elders serve on the church's governing body (called Session), take part in planning committees, assist in worship, serve communion, and help the pastors nurture, teach, and encourage the congregation.
